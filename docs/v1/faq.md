## Running DoucmentDB in Kubernetes

### Everyone knows that stateful workloads like PostgreSQL cannot run in Kubernetes. Why do you say the contrary?

An independent research survey commissioned by the Data on Kubernetes Community in September 2021 revealed that half of the respondents run most of their production workloads on Kubernetes. 90% of them believe that Kubernetes is ready for stateful workloads, and 70% of them run databases in production. Databases like Postgres. However, according to them, significant challenges remain, such as the knowledge gap (Kubernetes and Cloud Native, in general, have a steep learning curve) and the quality of Kubernetes operators. The latter is the reason why we believe that an operator like DocumentDB operator highly contributes to the success of your project.
